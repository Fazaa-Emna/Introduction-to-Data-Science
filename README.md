## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find in this repository:
1- Course Material
2- A Notebook guide to your first Data Science project based on the Crisp-DM methodology

## ðŸš€ Beginner Project: CRISP-DM Methodology

The beginner project follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology, which provides a structured approach to solving data-driven problems in six stages:

1. **Business Understanding**: Define the objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collect the data, explore it, and identify any data quality issues.
3. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data for modeling, including cleaning, transforming, and selecting features.
4. **Modeling**: Choose the appropriate modeling techniques and apply them to the prepared data.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance to ensure it meets the business objectives.
6. **Deployment**: (Optional) Deploy the model to a production environment or generate reports.

### Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the beginner project:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine

2. **Navigate to the project folder** where the notebook is located

3. **Open the Jupyter notebook** (`explaing-crisp-dm-data-science-methodology (1).ipynb`) in your preferred environment

4. **Follow the step-by-step guide** in the notebook to complete the project, starting from business understanding to model evaluation.

### Project Workflow

The project is organized into the following sections within the notebook:

1. **Business Understanding**: Problem definition and goals.
2. **Data Understanding**: Initial data exploration, visualization, and summary statistics.
3. **Data Preparation**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation.
4. **Modeling**: Selection and training of machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forest, logistic regression).
5. **Evaluation**: Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
6. **Conclusion**: Insights and recommendations based on the results.

Make sure to follow each step to fully understand the CRISP-DM process and apply it to your own dataset.
